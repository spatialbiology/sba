Dr. Rong did his Ph.D. at UCBerkley, postdoctoral work at CalTech, and is currently an associate professor in the department of biomedical engineering at Yale university. 

His lab works on developing single-cell technologies to study cellular heterogeneity and inter-cellular signaling network in human health and disease. They have also developed high-throughput technologies for co-analyzing single-cell epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic profiles.

He has co-founded several companies and is the recipient of numerous awards including the NCI Howard Temin Career Transition Award, the NSF CAREER Award, and the Packard Fellowship for Science and Engineering. He was recently elected a fellow of the National Academy of Inventors.
