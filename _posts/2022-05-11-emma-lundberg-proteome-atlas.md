Dr. Emma was a Professor in Cell Biology Proteomics at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden. She moved to Stanford and is an Associate Professor in the Department of Bioengineering at Stanford. 

Her research group works to understand how variations and deviations in protein expression patterns can contribute to cellular function and disease. She also directs the Cell Atlas wing of the Human Protein Atlas program, where she has been leading a significant effort for over 10 years to create a subcellular map of the entire human proteome. 

Emma has been the recipient of many awards. Most recently, she received the yoran Gustafson prize from the Swedish Academy of sciences for her pioneering work in developing technologies and tools for large-scale characterizations of the human proteome.
